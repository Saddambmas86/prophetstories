        biography: "Prophet Ilyas (AS) was sent to the people of Baalbek who worshiped the idol Baal. He challenged them to a contest to prove the falseness of their idol. When he prayed to Allah, fire came down and consumed his sacrifice, proving the truth of his message. However, the people continued in their disbelief.",
