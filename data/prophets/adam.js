    biography: `
        Prophet Adam (AS) is the first human created by Allah (SWT) and the first prophet in Islam. His story is mentioned in the Quran and Hadith.<br><br>

<b>1. Creation of Adam (AS)</b><br>
Allah created Adam (AS) from clay and breathed His spirit into him, giving him life. The angels were commanded to bow to Adam (AS) out of respect, and all did except Iblis (Shaytan), who refused out of arrogance.<br><br>

<b>2. Adam (AS) and Hawwa (Eve) in Paradise</b><br>
Adam (AS) and his wife, Hawwa (Eve), lived in Jannah (Paradise), where they were allowed to enjoy everything except one tree. Shaytan deceived them into eating from it, leading to their mistake.<br><br>

<b>3. Repentance and Forgiveness</b><br>
After realizing their error, Adam (AS) and Hawwa (AS) sincerely repented, and Allah (SWT) forgave them. However, they were sent to Earth as part of their test.<br><br>

<b>4. Life on Earth</b><br>
On Earth, Adam (AS) became the first prophet, teaching his children about Tawheed (monotheism) and righteousness. He had many children, including Qabil (Cain) and Habil (Abel), whose story involves the first murder.<br><br>

<b>5. Death and Legacy</b><br>
Adam (AS) lived for about 1000 years and was later buried in Mecca (according to some narrations). All humans are his descendants, and his story teaches us about repentance, humility, and obedience to Allah.<br><br>`,
