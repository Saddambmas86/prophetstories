        biography: "Prophet Hud (AS) was sent to the people of 'Ad, who were known for their strength and arrogance. They built great structures and were wealthy, but they turned to idol worship. Hud warned them of Allah's punishment, but they mocked him. A devastating wind destroyed them while Hud and the believers were saved.",
